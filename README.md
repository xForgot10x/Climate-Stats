# Climate-Stats
WIP

A logical continuation of my ClimateScraper script (https://github.com/xForgot10x/ClimateScraper). Only this time I use an SQLite database to store original data gathered from pogodaiklimat.ru without providing results straightaway. Instead, I am going to develop a web interface for drawing charts on demand.
So far I have rewritten my scraper to fit these needs.

Due to my recent relocation, I am in need of a new computer in order to continue.
